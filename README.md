Pixeltree's "18 Knoten"
=======================

... is a e-Learning game which tries to teach about the historical epoch known as the Age of Discovery. In a playful way it wants to convey an idea of the life on a ship in this great era of nautical exploration.

This project, whichs name translates to "eighteen knots" from German, is the accompanying exercise to a lecture about e-Learning applications and corresponding educational science held by the Faculty of Computer Science at TU Dresden (Germany; [http://inf.tu-dresden.de/portal.php?node_id=1&ln=en&group=13]).

As it is an exercise it may never leave the stage of development as it is rather a proof of concept (or rather proof of unterstanding of concepts) than a fully fledged application. In the future it will be available under a free (software) license, which has yet to be decided upon.
